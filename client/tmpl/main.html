    <h1>Hi I'm Alan Christensen</h1>
    <p>
      I'm from Richfield, Utah. I'm currently studying at Utah State University in Logan and working on my Bachelors in Computer Science. Programming is my hobby/occupation. I love to be able to create whatever I can think of.

      I have always been curious about how things work. As a kid I took everything apart. I just wanted to know how it works. I got into computers when I was in High School. One of our computers broke and I thought it was a perfect oppotunity to learn how it works. I took all of the pieces out of it and successfully put it back together. With some replacement parts I made it work!
